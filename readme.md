## Install

### Yarn

```bash
yarn add mheap
```

### NPM

```bash
npm install mheap
```

## In Depth

A binary heap is a heap data structure that takes the form of a binary heap, with two additional constraints:

- **Shape property**: A binary heap is a complete binary heap, that is all levels of the heap, except possibly the last one / deepest are fully filled, and, if the last level of the heap is not complete, the nodes of that level are filled from left to right.

- **Heap property**: The key stored in each node is either greater than or equal to or less than or equal to the keys in the node's children, according to the maximum & minimum total orders, respectively.

Heaps, where the parent key is greater than or equal to the child keys are called max-heaps, and those where it is less than or equal to are called min-heaps.

Mheap binary min & max heaps are internally implemented with an array, where nodes are stored by the level order traversal of the heap and the root node is always placed at index 0. This is due to the fact that any binary heap can be stored in an array, but because a binary heap is always a complete binary heap, it can be compactly & uniquely represented by storing its level order traversal in an array. As a result, no space is required for pointers, instead, the parent and children of each node are found by arithmetic calculations on array indices.

## Usage

Mheap exposes a chainable API, that can be utilized through a simple and minimal syntax, allowing you to combine methods effectively.

Usage examples can be also found at the [`test`](https://github.com/klaussinani/mheap/heap/master/test) directory.

```js
'use strict';
const {MaxHeap, MinHeap, Node} = require('mheap');

const maxHeap = new MaxHeap();
//=> MaxHeap { data: [] }

maxHeap.insert(15, 'A');
//=> MaxHeap { data: [Node { key: 15, value: 'A' }] }

maxHeap.root;
//=> Node { key: 15, value: 'A' }

const node = new Node(15, 'A');

maxHeap.root.toPair();
//=> [15, 'A']

maxHeap.root.key === node.key;
//=> true

maxHeap.root.value === node.value;
//=> true

maxHeap.insert(10, 'B').insert(5, 'C');
//=> MaxHeap { data: [
// Node { key: 15, value: 'A' },
// Node { key: 10, value: 'B' },
// Node { key: 5, value: 'C' } ] }

maxHeap.left(0);
//=> Node { key: 10, value: 'B' }

maxHeap.right(0);
//=> Node { key: 5, value: 'C' }

maxHeap.insert(7, 'D').insert(8, 'E').insert(2, 'F');
//=> MaxHeap { data: [
// Node { key: 15, value: 'A' },
// Node { key: 10, value: 'B' },
// Node { key: 5, value: 'C' },}
// Node { key: 7, value: 'D' },
// Node { key: 8, value: 'E' },
// Node { key: 2, value: 'F' } ] }

maxHeap.search(8);
//=> Node { key: 8, value: 'E',

maxHeap.includes(2);
//=> true

maxHeap.includes(100);
//=> false

maxHeap.height();
//=> 2

maxHeap.indexOf(7);
//=> 3

maxHeap.remove(1);
//=> MaxHeap { data: [
// Node { _key: 15, _value: 'A' },
// Node { _key: 8, _value: 'E' },
// Node { _key: 5, _value: 'C' },
// Node { _key: 7, _value: 'D' },
// Node { _key: 2, _value: 'F' } ] }

maxHeap.children(0);
//=> { left: Node { key: 8, value: 'E' },
// right: Node { key: 5, value: 'C' } }

maxHeap.extractMax();
//=> Node { key: 15, value: 'A' }

maxHeap.toPairs();
//=> [ [ 8, 'E' ], [ 7, 'D' ], [ 5, 'C' ], [ 2, 'F' ] ]
```

## API

The following documentation holds for both binary max & min heaps. The below described `heap` instance is used to depict the same methods that are available to both a min and a max heap, without overlooking their above described differences and unique qualities. For dedicated methods to min or max binary heaps, the `min` & `max` instances are used respectively.
